This is our Master thesis which is titled:
Analysis of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) with Machine Learning

We are going to detect zero day attack using reinforcement learning algorithm.

Here we will use following algorithm to detect DdoS , Probe , R2L  and spoofing attack.
1.Deep Reinforcement Learning
2.Q learning
3.Deep Q Network
4.Dyna Q
5.PDS
6.Na√Øve Bayes
7.SVM
8.k-NN
